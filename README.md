# 2dMinimapHTMLCanvas
A simple 2d (x, y) minimap made through HTML Canvas. 


After inputting the search radius (>99px), you must create an object (by clicking somewhere on the page). The first object created will act as a center, and will search for objects within/on the radius of that center you inputted. 

You can create object by clicking somewhere on the page. Every click event, the minimap and the page will update to show for the object that was just added.
